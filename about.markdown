The Author of these posts is John Aquilino (hereinafter referred to as "I").
I have been a code developer for quite some time, learning the C programming language back in 1983.
Yes, I am coming up on my 40th year anniversary of C programming.
Along the way becoming experienced at C++, Java, Perl, Python, and Javascript.

This "blog" just contains a random set of observations and opinions with no specific theme.

It does, however, use a typographical theme.
It leverages the theme titled **centratrium** by Ben Centra.
I probably did it wrong, but retrieving the theme from its repository, and
just copying the files into my own repository, but there it is.
Tried to make it work as a remote_theme, but I seemed to have made one or more mistakes.
The source repository can be found at [Centratrium](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium).
