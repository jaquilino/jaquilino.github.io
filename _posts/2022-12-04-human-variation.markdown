Pick any two people on planet Earth, any two.
Science tells us that any two randomly-chosen individuals
vary by at most 1 out of every 1000 genes,
meaning the average human is 99.9% the same as any one other.

Humanity actually demonstrates a remarkably small amount of genetic variation.
It is currently estimated that all of humanity is descended from
a population of 1,000 to 10,000 breeding pairs, a population
of about the size of Monaco or San Marino.
From this small population descends every single human being on planet Earth.
We are all one people.

We have come to classify individuals by the color of their skin,
referring to these classes as _race_.
Genetically, however, there is no rationale for such classifications.
There is no justification for separating people in this way,
as evidenced by the ease with which individuals of differing skin coloration
can produce children.
We refer to these children as 'mixed race'.
But this makes no more sense than classifying people by the color of their eyes.

## A digression on male vs female
So one may ask whether this same applies to a person's sex?
Genetically, one can clearly distinguish between a male and a female,
based on whether the 23rd chromosome contains short (a Y chromosome) or a long (an X chromosome) component.
A chromosome always consists of a pair, one is always an X, the difference is in the other member of the pair.
When a person has an X paired with a Y, they are a male.
when a person has two X, they are a female.
When they are combined biologically, (to produce a child), there is no mixing,
the resulting child will have a 23rd chromosome that is either XX (a female) or XY (a male).
These are definitions.
(OK, I realize the term _combined biologically_ is an odd way of putting it.)

There are a small percentage of humans that have genetic abnormalites.
There has to date never been a reported occurence of a human with a YY chromosome (ref: [Karotyping](https://karyotypinghub.com/are-yy-chromosomes-possible/){:target=_blank}).
There are occurrences of XYY chromosomes, where a person has an "extra" Y chromosome.
Such individuals are said to suffer _Jacob's syndrome_ and mormally referred to as _males_ (ref: [XYY Syndrome](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/xyy-syndrome/){:target=_blank}).
There have been occurences of XXY and XXYYY combinations, which are rarer still.
Some individuals with XX (with female organs internally) and XY (with male organs internally), who further develop
additional external genitalia of the other sex.
These latter individuals are referred with the term _hermaphrodite_.
Individuals with the above abnormalities face severe social issues, but remain genetically born one way or the other.

a long way of saying **genetically** humans are either male or female.
There is no mixing, and no alternatives.
