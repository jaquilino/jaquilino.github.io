Pick any two people on planet Earth, any two.
Science tells us that any two randomly-chosen individuals
vary by at most 1 out of every 1000 genes,
meaning the average human is 99.9% the same as any one other.

Humanity actually demonstrates a remarkably small amount of genetic variation.
It is currently estimated that all of humanity is descended from
a population of 1,000 to 10,000 breeding pairs, a population
of about the size of Monaco or San Marino.

We have come to classify individuals by the color of their skin,
referring to these classes as _race_.
Genetically, however, there is no rationale for such classifications.
There is no justification for separating people in this way,
as evidenced by the ease with which individuals of differing skin coloration
can produce children.
We refer to these children as 'mixed race'.
But this makes no more sense than separating people by the color of their eyes.
