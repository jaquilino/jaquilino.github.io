There are something between 3000 and 7000 separate languages spoken on planet Earth.
Over 40% of the world's languages are considered _endangered_
and at risk of dying out.
A language is considered endangered when it has fewer than 1000 speakers,
and is no longer being taught to children.
There are initiatives around the world to preserve
these languages.
I have to ask:
			
Why?

The lack of a common language separates people.
Where a language is not shared, it is the very definition
of a failure to communicate.
I contend that humanity needs not language **preservation**,
but language **consolidation**.
Endangered languages should be allowed to die out.
