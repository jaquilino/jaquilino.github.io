There are between 3000 and 7000 separate languages spoken on planet Earth. [1](https://www.ethnologue.com/guides/how-many-languages)
Over 40% of the world's languages are considered _endangered_
and at risk of dying out.
A language is considered endangered when it has fewer than 1000 speakers,
and is no longer being taught to children.
There are initiatives around the world to preserve
these languages, both public [2](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000192416) and
private [3](https://www.endangeredlanguages.com/) [4](https://livingtongues.org/).
I have to ask:
			
Why?

The lack of a common language separates people.
Where a language is not shared, it is the very definition
of a failure to communicate.
I contend that humanity needs not language **preservation**,
but language **consolidation**.
Endangered languages should be allowed to die out.

A small number of languages have become widely used.
The 23 highest ranked languages in terms of the number of speakers
are spoken by more than half of all of humanity.[1](https://www.ethnologue.com/guides/how-many-languages)
Eight of the top 10 are spoken natively across multiple nations.
Why have these 8 come to be so widely used?
They are the languages of empires.
