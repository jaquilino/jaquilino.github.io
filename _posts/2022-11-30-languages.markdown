There are between 3000 and 7000 separate languages spoken on planet Earth. [1](https://www.ethnologue.com/guides/how-many-languages){:target="_blank"}
Over 40% of the world's languages are considered _endangered_
and at risk of dying out.
A language is considered endangered when it has fewer than 1000 speakers,
and is no longer being taught to children.
There are initiatives around the world to preserve
these languages, both public [2](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000192416){:target="_blank"} and
private [3](https://www.endangeredlanguages.com/){:target="_blank"} [4](https://livingtongues.org/){:target="_blank"}.
I have to ask:
			
Why?

The lack of a common language separates people.
Where a language is not shared, it is the very definition
of a failure to communicate.
I contend that humanity needs not language **preservation**,
but language **consolidation**.
The myth/legend of the Tower of Babel from the Judeo-Christian tradition is instructive here.
In this story, early humanity shared a common language, and strove as a community
to construct a tower to reach to the heavens.
This led to the supernatural authority (referred to as "the Lord") saying
"Come, let us go down and confuse their languages there, so that they will not understand one another's speech".
(It's not clear who the Lord is speaking to in this context.)
This was the foundational myth within the Judeo-Christian tradition to explain
why there are multiple languages spoken by humanity.
The lesson of the story is that the multiplicity of languages _separated_ humanity.

A small number of languages have become widely used.
The 23 highest ranked languages in terms of the number of speakers
are spoken by more than half of all of humanity.[1](https://www.ethnologue.com/guides/how-many-languages){:target="_blank"}
Eight of the top 10 are spoken natively across multiple nations.
Why have these 8 come to be so widely used?
They are the languages of empires.
The most widely spoken languages have become dominant through what are now considered reprehensible means&#8212;using military dominance
to prevent teaching of native languages and/or to force the teaching of the dominant one,
using the dominance of the political system to enforce use of the dominant language,
enforcing laws to prevent the use of a native language, etc.
The retrospective judgment that these practices were, at best, incorrect and in the modern age considered reprehensible
that we perceive the endangered languages are deserving preservation.

This is not to advocate the continued use or the re-introduction of these measures to extend the use of current dominant languages.
The issue is whether humanity benefits from multiple thousands of languages.
It has been estimated that 96% of the world's least spoken languages are spoken by only 3% of humanity.[5](https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2018/04/Indigenous-Languages.pdf){:target="_blank"}
We advocate for the ceasing of attempts to preserve endangered languages,
except perhaps under curated circumstances, such as through the use of museums or other historical preservation mechanisms.
Perhaps humanity starts by concentrating on the most 500 or 1000 commonly spoken languages.
Endangered languages should be allowed to die out.
