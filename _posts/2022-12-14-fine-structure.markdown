There are individuals of a religious bent who will seek to convince others of the existence of God.
This will often descend into a back-and-forth of statements from a foundational religious document, such as the Christian Bible.
The problem with this is that both sides of the discussion, the advocate and the individual or group they are advocating to,
must BOTH accept the statements of the foundational document as truth.
The trouble is the people being advocated to don't accept the documents as truth.'

I honor and respect your faith, but I do not share it.

A scholarly discipline which better enables for the clearer making of conclusions between parties is that of science.
But the religious often, very often, are reluctant to use arguments of science.
There are knoen tenets of science that **could** support a contention that God exists.
For example, the well-understood principle of science that the universe began in a single moment of creation, the Big Bang.
Scientists are reluctant to extend the Big Bang to being the work of a Creator, but it's a stronger argument.
Seems like the Big Bang is entirely consistent with 'And God said, "Let there be light"!'

Science estimates the age of the Universe at 13.8 _billion_ years.
Some religious positions are that existence is much shorter, so that this age cannot be true.
But why wouldn't an age in the billions of years also be consistent with a being that is purported to be eternal and timeless?
Wouldn't such a being exist _at least_ billions of years?

Another scientific item that offers just as strong an argument is the **fine structure constant**.
I'm hard pressed to explain precisely what the fine structure constant actually is,
but the principle is this:
It is a constant value equal to approximately one over 137.
If this constant were a value slightly smaller&#8212;or slightly larger&#8212;all matter in the universe **could not exist**.
But science cannot explain why the fine structure constant has this specific value.
Seems like the Universe is finely tuned to the presence of matter, and therefore, the presence of humanity.

So to the religious seeking to convince others of the existence of God,
don't argue the Bible, or any other such document.
Argue the fine structure constant.
